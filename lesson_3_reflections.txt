When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
- working from multiple client machines
- other people work on the same project
- havin a backup

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
- there may be conflicts
- i may not want the changed from the remote repo yet

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
- Forks are cloned repos on github inside a new repo
- clones are copie of a repo
- branches are a bunch of commits taged with a label

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
- Work offline more easily by fetching the remote
- can use git tools offline

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
- asking for a code review manually
- more room for error and lazyness (no due process)
