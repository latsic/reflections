When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
- working from multiple client machines
- other people work on the same project
- havin a backup

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
- there may be conflicts
- i may not want the changed from the remote repo yet
